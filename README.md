## Technologies
* Python 3.x
* Natural Language processing (NLP)

* AWS EC2 (c3.4xlarge)

## Dataset
* Twitter Dataset from 5 Telcos
* Size: 1.5 GB ( 300 MB approx from each Telco)
* Tweets: 5 million (1 million from each Telco)
* Dataset folder has only sample of data (10K tweets) 


## Setup
The project originally run in High-end cloud (AWS EC2 c3.4xlarge) due to high volume of data.
The project can be run in stand-alone machine with sample data from orginal datasets.
```
-> copy Code and Dataset folders onto PC or Cloud Compute machines
-> Open ipython (Jupyter) notebook.
-> Upload .ipynb files
-> Changes the file path as per the OS and run all cells.
-> Alternatively .py files can be executed directly from command prompt / bash. provide the input folder path when asked.

```
